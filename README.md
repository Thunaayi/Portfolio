# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio. It's a grid-based site built to show what I've been working on.

## What's inside

- Grid layout inspired by Metro design.
- Different themes like Neon, Glass, and Retro.
- Detailed looks at my main projects.
- Contact form that actually sends emails through Formspree.

## Tech

- Next.js
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion

## Main Projects

### ExamExpert
A full-stack LMS I built for online exams. 
Front: React, Redux, React Query. 
Back: Node, Express, MongoDB.

### AceMrcem
A study platform for doctors preparing for the MRCEM exams. It has a complex content structure and a timed exam simulator.

## Run it locally

1. Install things:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Export for hosting:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

The site exports to a static `out/` folder, so it works on GitHub Pages or any static host.
